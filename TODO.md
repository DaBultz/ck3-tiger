## Bugs

* @key = value also works in event files, should be parsed
* scripted_trigger (probably also scripted_effect) in event files are per-file. They can be overridden by the general ones from common though.

## Features

* The validations in IDEAS.md
* Warn if vanilla redefines something from the mod. Tricky because logging is turned off for vanilla items.
