## Bugs

### Display

* The caret placement for error messages assumes 1 byte of the source string = 1 space, which is inaccurate both for tabs and for multibyte characters.
* The column numbers reported for pdxscript files are wrong.
* There are some non-Unicode files in CK3. The error reporting tries to load them as Unicode anyway.

## Features

* The validations in IDEAS.md
